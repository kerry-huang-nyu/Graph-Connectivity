### 9/12:
Completed
1. Created Boolean class + algorithm  
2. Started Graph class 

Meeting: 
1. Finished Graph class
2. Issue with efficient disconnect function 

### 9/19:
Tasks:

### 10/3:
Tasks: 
1. Simulation
2. Meet with Haya 

Meeting:
1. Demoed the webapp
2. Discussed the possiblity of 2 approx to 1 certificate. Largest bundle is the mole. 0 certificate is the problem.
