# Todo list: 

~~1. Make sure that multigraphs can be represented ~~
~~2. Make sure that the algorithm to solve the simplest algorithm ~~
~~3. Make sure the algorithm can monte carlo ~~
~~4. Make the 1 and 0 certificate functions ~~

Todo:
~~1. create a relatively simple but efficient deconnected determination ~~
~~2. graph connectivity algorithms to test the interface/heuristics ~~
~~3. 2 connected graphs: connectivity measure ~~
~~1. dotted edges and then have an intuitive ui ~~


1. Make sure that you have test cases in pytest to run for this project 

Todo: 
1. ~~Implement 1 verification algo + show optimality ~~
2. Implement 0 verification heuristic dfs and compare empirically 
3. Webapp can model much more algos: 
    - create a little 




    random multi cycle? 
    interface input for edges 
    toggle for different algorithms
    toggle for diffeent graphs 
    
    run experiments and reflect on the experiments. do they do very bad? come up with different heuristics
